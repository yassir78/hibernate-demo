JPQL tips :

1- use a from Class => generates a full query
2- Adding a SELECT clause to a JPQL query requires assignment of an alias to the queried :
    select i from Item as i or select i from Item i
3- In case of inhreritence :
               MainClass
              /       \
       SubClass1   SubClass2
querying MainClass : SELECT o FROM MainClass o, will query both subclasses
